# debian_setup
Speed up the basic setup of your Debian Pc or Server.

The purpose of this script is to speed up the process 
of configuring virtual machines (with VirtualBox) based 
on Debian. This script has been created and used several 
times, either in virtual machines or in physical machines. 


With this script you will be in the position of:

- update and upgrade your system
- Install all these previously selected programs
- Back up some configuration files (interfaces, sshd_config, etc)
- Change host name
- Change your dynamic IP to a static one.

In the future I will try to add more functionalities to 
the script, such as generating the ssh key, starting 
the ssh service among others. I will be very grateful 
if anyone has any suggestions about what to add or improve. 

Note that in this script I only use free software (firmware-linux-free).
